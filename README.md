# AccountManagementForNewsPaperVendor
This is an account management app for a newspaper vendor. The app enables  existing  newspaper vendor to compute his total sales per newspaper type per week. Based on the newspaper vendor sales record over a period of time, and also registers or onboard  a new vendor before he or she can use the app for accounting purposes.

The app is able to predict or forecast which newspaper the vendor should invest more money in over the next week and what quantity.

***I also tried to use the concept of OOP  to implement the solution but I couldnt finish before the deadline to submit, I hope to go back to it much later

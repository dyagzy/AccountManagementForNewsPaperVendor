# AccountManagementForNewsPaperVendor
This is an account management app for a newspaper vendor. The app enables a newspaper vendor to compute his total sales per newspaper type per week. Based on the newspaper vendor sales record over a period of time, this app is able to predict or forecast which newspaper the vendor should invest more money in over the next week and what quantity.
*****The technonolgy used is an Asp.Net Framework version 4.7.2. ****
I have used an OOP technology for the backend while its front end is an console App, where the vendor can enter required parameters of his business.
